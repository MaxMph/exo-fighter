This is Exo-Fighter!

Exo-Fighter is a top-down, pixel art shooter. you play as a citizen living on the bottom floor of a massive space station. with the goal of making it out of the bottom floor you set out to gather enough money to buy passage upwards, but its not a small sum.
to get enough money you delve into the abandoned layer, looking for anything that could get you some cash from the market. Unfortunately it's abandoned for a reason, and dangers lurk behind every corner.

controls:
  WASD to move
  mouse to aim
  leftclick to shoot
  F to interact

I couldnt get this to a super playable state in time.
whats missing:
  I wasnt able to set up an inventory system.
  no save system.
  music doesnt stay continus when changeing scenes.
  only one enemy variation, no random spawning or patrolling. (I did actualy make two enemies, but i couldnt get the more complex one working)
  there is no way to extract from the abandoned layer other than dying... not ideal.
  buying upgrades doesnt do anything (since there isnt any inventory).
